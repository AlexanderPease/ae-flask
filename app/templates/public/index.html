          The Institute of Applied Entrepreneurship was created by venture development company Prehype. Prehype is a network of entrepreneurs that launch companies by themselves or in collaboration with corporations. After building 45+ companies, we realized that there is a common methodology, process, and structure to getting any business off the ground. We created Applied Entrepreneurship to share those learnings with you.
